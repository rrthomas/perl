# RRT Perl Modules

A collection of miscellaneous Perl modules that I use in my own code. Maybe
one day I’ll work out how to publish them on CPAN.

These Perl modules are free software, licensed under the GNU GPL version 3
(or, at your option, any later version).

Please send questions, comments, and bug reports to the maintainer, or
report them on the project’s web page (see above for addresses).
